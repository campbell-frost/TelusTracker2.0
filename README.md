## About

This is a desktop app designed to help my friends track how long they spend on tasks at work.  TelusTracker2.0 was build with with Go and React using the Wails framework.

## Getting started

```console
cd frontend
```

```console
npm install
```

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
